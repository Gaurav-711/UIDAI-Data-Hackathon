# UIDAI-Data-Hackathon
**Unlocking Societal Trends in Aadhaar Enrolment and Updates (UIDAI Hackathon 2026)**  
A data-driven analytics project that identifies meaningful patterns, trends, hotspots, anomalies, and forecasting indicators from Aadhaar enrolment and update activity datasets.

---

## 📌 Overview
Aadhaar enrolment and update operations generate large-scale activity data across time and geography. This project analyzes UIDAI-provided Aadhaar datasets to:

- understand **activity trends** over time
- identify **high-demand hotspots** (state / district / PIN code level)
- compute **Update Pressure Ratio** to quantify update intensity
- perform **anomaly detection** on activity spikes/drops
- generate **short-horizon forecasts** for future service load

The project is designed to run efficiently on limited compute resources (Google Colab / laptop) using **chunk-wise reading** and **stratified sampling** of large CSV files.
